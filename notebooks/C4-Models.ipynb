    "# Multilevel architecture design - C4 Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The C4 model is a framework for visualizing the architecture of software systems, created by Simon Brown. It provides a hierarchical set of diagrams that represent different levels of abstraction in a system, making it easier for different stakeholders to understand the architecture. The name \"C4\" stands for \"Context, Container, Component, and Code,\" which are the four levels of diagrams that make up the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Four Levels of the C4 Model:\n",
    "1. Context Diagram:\n",
    "- Purpose: To provide a high-level overview of the system and its interactions with external entities.\n",
    "- Audience: All stakeholders, including technical and non-technical people.\n",
    "- Details: Shows the system under consideration, its users, and other systems it interacts with. It answers the question, \"What is the system and who are its users?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Container Diagram:\n",
    "- Purpose: To show the high-level shape of the software architecture and how responsibilities are distributed across different containers.\n",
    "- Audience: Technical people, including software architects and developers.\n",
    "- Details: Depicts the major containers (applications or services) that make up the system, their responsibilities, and how they communicate. Containers can include web applications, databases, microservices, and other types of execution environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Component Diagram:\n",
    "- Purpose: To decompose each container into its constituent components and show how they interact.\n",
    "- Audience: Software architects and developers.\n",
    "- Details: Illustrates the major logical components within a container, their responsibilities, and the interactions between them. This level focuses on the internal structure of a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Code (Class) Diagram:\n",
    "- Purpose: To provide detailed design of individual components, typically using UML class diagrams.\n",
    "- Audience: Developers.\n",
    "- Details: Shows the implementation details of a specific component, including classes, methods, and relationships between classes. This level is optional and often used for complex components where additional detail is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of the C4 Model\n",
    "Clarity and Communication: By providing different levels of abstraction, the C4 model helps in communicating the architecture to various stakeholders, from non-technical people to developers.\n",
    "Scalability: The model scales from high-level overviews to detailed designs, making it suitable for large and complex systems.\n",
    "Consistency: Using a standardized approach to diagramming ensures consistency and clarity across different parts of the system and different projects.\n",
    "Focus on Different Aspects: Each level of the C4 model focuses on a different aspect of the system, ensuring that all important details are covered."
