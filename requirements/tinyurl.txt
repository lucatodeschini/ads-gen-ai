The service will create an alias for the original URL with a shorter length. If you click on the shorter URL it should redirect to the longer URL.

Functional Requirements:
- Given a url, generate a shorter and unique alias of it
- When user accesses short link, redirect them to the original url

Nonfunctional Requirements:
- 99.99% Availability
- 150ms latency on redirection
- Links expire at 5 years by default
- Should perform globally
- All urls are public

Assumptions:
- Each url is 500 bytes
- 20% of URLs can be stored in a cache
- Cache TTL 24 hrs

Estimated Usage:
- 100 Reads per Write
- 500,000 urls created every month
