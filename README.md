# Architecture Design Session with Gen AI

This repo includes a few jupyter notebooks for testing architecture design using GenAI

To create a Python virtual environment for running a Jupyter notebook, follow these instructions based on your operating system:

**Linux:**
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.
3. Run the command `python3 -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment named "venv".
4. Activate the virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate`.
5. Install Jupyter notebook by running `pip install jupyter`.
6. Start the Jupyter notebook server by running `jupyter notebook`.

**Windows:**
1. Open a command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.
3. Run the command `python -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment named "venv".
4. Activate the virtual environment by running `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`.
5. Install Jupyter notebook by running `pip install jupyter`.
6. Start the Jupyter notebook server by running `jupyter notebook`.

**macOS:**
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.
3. Run the command `python3 -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment named "venv".
4. Activate the virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate`.
5. Install Jupyter notebook by running `pip install jupyter`.
6. Start the Jupyter notebook server by running `jupyter notebook`.
